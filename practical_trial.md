### Practice projects to consider:

1. Implement a basic search engine: Read a set of documents and build an index of keywords. Then, implement a search function that returns a list of documents that match the query.

2. Build a recommendation system: Read a set of user-item interactions and build a recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their past behavior.

3. Create a data analysis tool: Read a large dataset and implement a tool that performs various analyses, such as calculating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying patterns and correlations.

4. Implement a graph algorithm: Study a graph algorithm such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and implement it in Python. Then, test it on real-world graphs to see how it performs.
